    "wird die Frage kontrovers diskutiert, in- wiefern die Bildungspolitik bzw. das Bil- dungssystem als Teil der Sozialpolitik betrachtet werden solle. Doch wird in den letzten Jahren unter dem Gesichtspunkt der sozialen Chancengleichheit und der sozialen Investitionen die sozialpolitische Relevanz der Bildungspolitik verstärkt thematisiert (vgl. Allmendinger/Leibfried 2003).",

    "The Loneliness of the Unem- ployed: Social and Political Participation in Germany in a European Context The economic and social crisis highlights the importance of social connections, as they could potentially function as a sort of ”personal safety net“. These connections can provide social support, access to information, informal help or jobs, emotional support (Coleman 1990), and may deeply aefct an individual’s ability to cope with job loss or declining incomes. On a social level, political activities, volunteering, helping each other, keeping a promise or telling the truth, are the “cement of society”. It becomes critically important in a social climate of increasing uncertainty and risk. This article focuses on social and political participation indicators, including trust, social meetings, political activities and social isolation. We present Germany in a European context, and also compare the situation of specicfi social groups in Germany. The unemployed are particularly exposed to social isolation: about one out of eight German unemployed have no close friend at all. In addition, they are less likely to be politically active, which reduces their interest representation potentials.",
    "There is an increasing recognition among policy-makers that “social connections and relationships” are a key dimension of well-being, reflected for example in the European years of Volunteering (2011) and that of Active Ageing (2012). The report by the “Stiglitz Commission” (Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi 2009) includes “social connections and relationships” as one of the dimensions of well-being.",
    "The actions of one’s peers and the group norm have a profound influence on indi- vidual’s behaviour, although the impact is not always positive (mafia, gangs). In addi- tion to our immediate connections, there is a more indirect network effect. Eating habits, health attitudes, sex norms are transferred to us through the friends of our friends, and we are influenced by people we do not even know personally (Christakis and Fowler 2009).",
    "Social capital can be regarded as a goal in itself, as social relationships, and interper- sonal trust proved to bring happiness to people’s lives (Helliwell 2006). Marriage has the strongest effects (both in a positive and a negative way), but friends tend to be the source of companionship, and are leisure partners (Argyle 1999). People with stronger support networks were found to live longer (ibid, p. 362). People with more friends live longer in part because of the biochemical effects of social isolation, and in part because public health systems are more effective in areas of higher social capital (Stiglitz, Sen et al. 2009). Social isolation is a risk factor for premature death, to nearly the same degree as smoking (Berkman and Glass 2000).",
    "Social networks provide (1) social support, (2) social influence, (3) social engagement and attachment, and (4) access to resources and material goods (Berkman et al 2000).",
    "Granovetter (1973, 1983) distinguishes between “strong ties” which provide emo- tional support, and “weak ties” (acquain- tances) which have a larger reach, and thus can be more useful with providing infor- mation or access to resources (e.g. jobs) or organizing collective action.",

    "Jürgen Kohl, Max-Weber-Institut für Soziologie Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg Tel.: 06221-542980 juergen.kohl@soziologie.uni- heidelberg.de Unemployment was shown to have a nega- tive impact on well-being, over and above the income loss (Winkelmann and Winkel- mann 1998). Unemployment hurts, as it harms self-esteem and may bring a loss in personal connections and a sense of aim- lessness. The detrimental effects are likely to be greater in cases where unemployment is involuntary and came unexpectedly.",
    "Social connections, especially contacts with employed friends, may help with finding jobs. On the other hand, the company of other workless people may ease the pain of unemployment as joblessness may feel more “normal“ (Clark 2003).",
    "This chapter focuses on social and political participation indicators, including (1) trust, (2) political activities, (3) social meetings and (4) social isolation, and discusses these four themes in this sequence. We seek to answer the following questions: – Are there significant differences in the level of social trust across social groups: which groups are the most and least trus- ting in Germany?
